# amd-fx-thermal-cpu-control
Thermald is not working properly so I decided to make my own
# how it works
It's a simple bash script that checks themperature for every 2 seconds and changes frequency if it's too hot.
Same way as thermald should work ( but it doesn't work for AMD cpus )
# how to install
Use makepkg if you're running Arch. Do it on your own if you're not :)
